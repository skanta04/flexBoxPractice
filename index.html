            <h3>Different Types of Pastas</h3>
            <h4>Penne, Farfalle, Rigatoni, Cavatappi</h4>
            <p><em>Penne: </em>A two-inch long, tube-shaped pasta that is cut diagonally at both ends. Great with chunky meat or vegetable sauces, as bits of the meat or veggies will slide into the pasta tubes.</p>
            <p><em>Farfalle: </em>Use farfalle pasta to dress up any dish that calls for small pasta shapes, such as penne or shells. Also known as bow-tie pasta.</p>
            <p><em>Rigatoni: </em>Short, grooved, tube-shaped "riggies" can be used in pretty much any setting, from sauces to salads to baked casseroles.</p>
            <p><em>Linguini:</em>These long, flat noodles are slightly thicker than spaghetti. The classic Italian restaurant pairing is clam sauce, but you can use this pasta in any dish that calls for spaghetti.</p>
